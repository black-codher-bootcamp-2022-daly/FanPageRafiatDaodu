                <p>Nigerian fashion designer Lisa Folawiyo is celebrated for her colourful collections that fuse traditional West African fabrics with modern tailoring and beaded embellishments.</p>
                <p>Though trained as a lawyer and having no knowledge in fashion, Lisa Folawiyo chose her passion and decided to pursue a career in fashion.</p>
                <blockquote><b><i>"In 2004, there arose an unquenchable desire to express myself through fashion design and have a loud voice heard in fashion the world over."</i></b></blockquote> 
                <p>With just ₦20,000 (approx £4,750) as an investment, Lisa bought twelve yards of fabric and made her first pieces with her seamstress mother in her home.</p>
                <p>Since starting her label in 2005, Folawiyo has spearheaded the movement of Nigerian designers achieving international recognition for their work.</p>
                <p>She has a knack for elevating traditional African prints above the status quo, making them relevant for a global audience.</p>
                <p>Her collections are exclusively crafted from Ankara textiles - vibrant wax-resistant dyed fabrics characteristic of West Africa.  She regularly collaborates with local artisans to showcase Nigerian fabrics, production processes and techniques such as hand sown embellishments, weaving (<b>Aṣọ òkè</b>) and <b>Àdìrẹ</b> (<i>indigo-dyed cotton cloths decorated using a resist-dying technique to create striking patterns in blue and white</i>).</p>
                <blockquote><b><i>"Our mothers, grandmothers and probably great-grandmothers have worn this fabric."</i></b></blockquote>
                <p>She has show rooms in both Nigeria and New York and her collections are stocked in the UK, the US, South Africa and Nigeria itself.</p>
